<p>Hello, David Louis here :^D <br>
    I'm a 27 cis-gendered male, who hopes to one day found mine own video gaming company, and not wait till the last second to finish my work! 
    I struggle very heavily with stress, anxiety, depression, and moving beyond the past. At times I even contiplated suicide and it's been a lingering struggle since.
    I thank God every day that I didn't take my life and that I'm here to speak with you now! 
    Among my skills, which I have no unbiased way of confirming, are: writing, coding, singing, voice acting, ...., hmmmm, bound to be, something else, to put, here........
